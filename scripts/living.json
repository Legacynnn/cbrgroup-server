The result is an iconographic piece, 100% upholstered, which brings new air to the high-end furniture market.",

With organic traits, its proposal is to meet living and home environments, including the most intimate spaces such as bedrooms. The fiberglass backrest adds, at the same time, lightness and durability to the piece, which brings another innovation: it is swivel. Confirming the comfort look, the armchair is composed of layers of foams on the seat, while the backrest has a highly soft hypersoft foam cushion.",
